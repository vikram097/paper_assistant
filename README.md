## 📖 About the Project

Enterprise Knowledge Assistant is a production-inspired Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to upload PDF documents, build a searchable knowledge base, and ask natural language questions over their content.

Unlike traditional chatbots that rely solely on a Large Language Model, this application retrieves relevant information from user-uploaded documents before generating responses. The retrieval pipeline combines dense vector search, BM25 keyword search, Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), and CrossEncoder re-ranking to improve retrieval accuracy and produce grounded answers.

The project is designed with a modular architecture using FastAPI for the backend, Streamlit for the frontend, and Qdrant as the vector database, making it suitable as a learning project for production-inspired RAG systems.
